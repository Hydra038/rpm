## 🔍 RECENTLY VIEWED IMAGE CACHING ISSUE - ANALYSIS & SOLUTIONS

### ❓ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

The "Recently Viewed" section is showing **cached data from localStorage** with old corrupted image URLs, even though the database has been updated with correct paths.

**Why this happens:**
- When users view/add products to cart, ProductCard component saves product data to localStorage
- This cached data includes the image URLs that were current at that time
- Even after database updates, the cached localStorage data retains the old corrupted image URLs
- Recently Viewed section uses this cached data instead of fetching fresh from database

### 🛠️ **IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS**

#### **Option 1: Clear Browser Cache (User Action)**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab  
3. Find localStorage > localhost:3000
4. Delete the "rpm-recently-viewed" key
5. Refresh the page

#### **Option 2: Browser Console Command**
```javascript
// Run this in browser console:
localStorage.removeItem("rpm-recently-viewed");
location.reload();
```

#### **Option 3: Clear All RPM localStorage**
```javascript
// Clear all RPM-related localStorage:
Object.keys(localStorage).forEach(key => {
  if (key.startsWith('rpm-')) {
    localStorage.removeItem(key);
  }
});
location.reload();
```

### 🔧 **TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS (Code Changes)**

#### **Solution 1: Add Cache Version System**
Update ProductCard to include a cache version that invalidates old data:

```typescript
// In ProductCard.tsx, update the handleAddToCart function:
function handleAddToCart() {
  setAddingToCart(true);
  addToCart({ id, name, price, image_url: image_url || '', quantity: 1 });
  
  // Add cache version for invalidation
  const CACHE_VERSION = '1.1'; // Increment when images change
  const recentlyViewed = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('rpm-recently-viewed') || '[]');
  
  // Check if cache needs invalidation
  const cacheVersion = localStorage.getItem('rpm-cache-version');
  if (cacheVersion !== CACHE_VERSION) {
    localStorage.setItem('rpm-cache-version', CACHE_VERSION);
    localStorage.removeItem('rpm-recently-viewed'); // Clear old cache
    recentlyViewed.length = 0; // Reset array
  }
  
  const productData = { 
    id: parseInt(id), 
    name, 
    price, 
    image_url, 
    category,
    cached_at: Date.now() // Add timestamp
  };
  const filtered = recentlyViewed.filter((p: any) => p.id !== parseInt(id));
  const updated = [productData, ...filtered].slice(0, 10);
  localStorage.setItem('rpm-recently-viewed', JSON.stringify(updated));
  
  setTimeout(() => setAddingToCart(false), 1000);
}
```

#### **Solution 2: Fresh Data Fetching for Recently Viewed**
Update ProductRecommendations to fetch fresh data:

```typescript
// In ProductRecommendations.tsx, add useEffect to refresh data:
useEffect(() => {
  async function refreshRecentlyViewed() {
    if (recentlyViewed.length === 0) return;
    
    const ids = recentlyViewed.map(p => p.id);
    const { data: freshData } = await supabase
      .from('parts')
      .select('id, name, price, image_url, category')
      .in('id', ids);
    
    if (freshData) {
      // Update localStorage with fresh data
      const updated = freshData.map(fresh => ({
        ...fresh,
        cached_at: Date.now()
      }));
      localStorage.setItem('rpm-recently-viewed', JSON.stringify(updated));
      // Trigger re-render if needed
    }
  }
  
  refreshRecentlyViewed();
}, []);
```

### 📋 **CURRENT DATABASE STATE**

✅ **All database image URLs are CORRECT:**

- **Windshield Wipers (ID: 111)** → `/images/products/electrical/windshield-wipers.jpg`
- **Spark Plug Set (ID: 55)** → `/images/products/electrical/spark-plugs-set.jpg`  
- **Spark Plugs Set (ID: 110)** → `/images/products/electrical/led-headlight-bulbs-h7.webp`

The issue is **ONLY** in the cached localStorage data, not the database or the main products page.

---

### 🎯 **RECOMMENDED ACTION**

**For immediate fix:** Clear the browser localStorage as shown above.

**For long-term solution:** Implement the cache version system to automatically invalidate old cached data when product images are updated.

---

### 🔍 **How to Verify Fix**

1. Clear localStorage using one of the methods above
2. Refresh the page (localhost:3000/products)
3. Add the problematic products to cart again (this will cache fresh data)
4. Check Recently Viewed section - should now show correct automotive images

The database is correct, the main products page is correct, only the cached Recently Viewed data needs refreshing! 🎉
