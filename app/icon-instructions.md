# RPM Favicon Created
This is a placeholder for the PNG icon. 
For a proper PNG icon, you would need to:
1. Use an image editor like GIMP, Photoshop, or online tools
2. Create a 512x512 pixel image with:
   - Blue circular background (#1e40af)
   - White "RPM" text (bold, centered)
   - Small gear/automotive symbol above the text
3. Export as PNG and replace this file

For now, the SVG icon will work perfectly and scale to all sizes.
